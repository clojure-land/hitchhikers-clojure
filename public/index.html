<p><em>The following is a cautionary example of the unpredictable
combination of Clojure, a marathon viewing of the BBC&rsquo;s series &ldquo;The
Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy&rdquo;, and a questionable amount of
cheese.</em></p>

<p>There have been many tourism guides to the
<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> programming language.  Some that easily
come to mind for their intellectual erudition and prose are &ldquo;The Joy
of Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Touring Clojure&rdquo;, &ldquo;Clojure Touring&rdquo;, and the
newest edition of &ldquo;Touring Clojure Touring&rdquo;.  However, none has
surpassed the wild popularity of &ldquo;The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo;.
It has sold over 500 million copies and has been on the &ldquo;BigInt&rsquo;s
Board of Programming Language Tourism&rdquo; for the past 15 years. While,
arguably, it
lacked the in-depth coverage of the other guides, it made up for it in
useful practical tips, such as what to do if you find a nil in your
pistachio.  Most of all, the cover had the following words printed in
very large letters: <strong>Don&rsquo;t Worry About the Parens</strong>.</p>

<p>To tell the story of the book, it is best to tell the story of two
people whose lives were affected by it: Amy Denn, one of the last
remaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language">Pascal</a> developers in Cincinnati, and Frank Pecan, a time
traveler, guidebook reseacher, and friend of Amy.</p>

<p>Amy, at this moment, was completely unaware of the chronological
advantages of her friend, being preoccupied with the stark fact that
she was about to be fired.  She had been given a direct order from her
CEO to deploy the code at 3:05pm.  It was now 3:00pm and she had
realized that if she did so, all the data painstaking collected about
the effects of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvan_throat_singing">Throat Singing</a> on
the growth rate of tomatoes would be erased. Unfortunately, the CEO
did not really understand or trust anything having to do with
technology or programming.  In truth, the only two things that he
seemed to care about were tomatoes and checklists of unreasonable
things. The fact that no course of action available to her in the next
5 minutes would help her employment situation, agitated Amy so much
that she was violently shelling and eating pistachio nuts.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; says that
<em>pistachios are Nature&rsquo;s
most perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">s-expression</a>. An
s-expression is recursively composed of s-expressions or an atom.
In the case of the humble pistachio, the atom is the nut inside. The
atom simply evaluates to itself.  This is best seen is an example
where the following expressions are evaluated in the Clojure
<a href="http://tryclj.com/">REPL</a></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="s">&quot;hi&quot;</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;hi&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 1</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">true</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>`</p>

<p><em>Which leads to the very practical tip of what to do if you find a nil
in your pistachio.  The answer, of course, is to be thankful that you
have a value that represents the absence of a value &ndash; and to get
another pistachio.</em></p>

<p><em>In Clojure, a s-expression is written with parens.  The first element
within the parens is an operator or function and the rest of the
elements are treated as data, some of which can be s-expression
themselves.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 3</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; 5</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Considering the pistachio again, we can think of the nut in the shell
as an s-expression, (providing we also imagine an operator or function
right in front of the nut).</em></p>

<p><em>Here we define a function that will turn the nut red, by appending the
string &ldquo;red&rdquo; to the nut-name.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">red</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str </span><span class="s">&quot;red &quot;</span> <span class="nv">nut</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; &quot;red nut1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Notice that if we put a quote in front of the expression, it will no
longer be evaluated.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">red</span> <span class="s">&quot;nut1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;;=&gt; (red &quot;nut1&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>quoting the expression turns it into a list, which we can then
manipulate with other s-expressions (code as data).</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>If we try to evaluate the s-expression with just the nut name in the
parens, we get an error because there is no function in
the first slot.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>The whole thing of having to have a function in front of the nut in
the pistachio has invited much heated debate on the suitability of
pistachios being held up as the paragon of an s-expression.  But
critics have failed to explain the corroborating evidence of red
pistachio nuts, or find a more suitable nut.</em></p>

<p>Amy&rsquo;s time traveling friend, Frank, is due to appear on the scene
momentarily to reveal that the whole world is really made of Clojure
<a href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> datoms.  Furthermore, a transaction
is going to be evaluated soon, which will retract all the facts on
EVERYTHING. The practical effect of this will be that nothing will
have an attributes. A world without any attributes at all would be
quite boring and, for all purposes, be non-existent. Luckily for Amy, Frank is a Datomic Time
Traveller and has a hand-held &ldquo;evaluator&rdquo; which will save them. Also
luckily, the readers will be spared dialog, since the author
can never figure out where to put the punctuation and is really
rubbish at it.  Only one phrase will be illustrated.  This is the
rather important one, having been uttered by Amy after it was explained to her
that she, and the entire world around her, was entirely composed of
Clojure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the language with a lot of parens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which, Frank handed her the &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure&rdquo; and
pointed to the words on the front cover,  <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry About the
Parens.&rdquo;</strong>, and turned to the first page.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;There is absolutely no need to worry about the parens. It is known
 today that the first really important discovery of humankind was not
 fire, but <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a>.  Paredit
 mode magically acts to insert and balance the right parens to the
 point where they actually can no longer be seen.  This is evident by
 just looking around you. The world is made of Clojure and there are
 millions, billions, and trillions of parens all around you and your
 tea cup right now.  Yet, you don&rsquo;t see them.  Paredit mode.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>At the urging of Frank, Amy quickly stuffed the remaining pistachios
in her pockets while he readied his evaluator. The display showed
some large integer value, that decreased as he pushed the buttons on
the console.  Finally, he pushed the large red button and two parens
started glowing on either side of them &hellip; and they disappeared.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amy and Frank were hurtled quite rapidly through time and space after
attaching themselves to a transaction headed through the
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/transactions.html">Datomic Transactor</a>. From
there things slowed down a bit, then took a sharp left and
ricocheted off again with incredible speed until they landed in another
<a href="http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html">Datomic Peer</a>, and finally
appeared in the same room.  Amy was quite startled by the
anti-climatic nature of the whole dematerializing and rematerializing
in the same exact spot, and didn&rsquo;t really know what to do next.  She
surveyed her office and found it exactly the same,
except for two distinct details.  For one, the pistachio shells had
disappeared, and for another, the date on the computer showed
yesterday at 8:00 am.  She tried to connect these facts rationally
with the pistachios in her pocket and finally said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about to come into work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank, who was busily hunting through his blue zippered pack around
his waist, looked up briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we better get out of here then, I only have a blue fanny pack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure explains that the &ldquo;fanny pack&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;bum bag&rdquo;, is the symbol of a licensed Chrono-agent.  The rank of the
Chrono-agent can be clearly determined by its color on the ROYGBIV
scale.</em></p>

<p><em>The origins of this licensing method can be traced to an embarrassing
incident in human history known as &ldquo;The Great Flood&rdquo;. A junior
Chrono-agent was trying to increase the yield of a tomato crop during
a dry spell and was trying to do the following recursive function in his evaluator:</em></p>

time he got there and stopped the rain, there was not much left to
work with. Thankfully, he was quite versed in lazy and infinite

<p>Amy was still watching Frank busily rumaging through his pack in the
office . Finally
he found what he
was looking for, his hand emerging triumphantly with a fistful of
mini-marshmallows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it. Come on, let&rsquo;s go! Someone is trying to destroy the world and
we need to see the otters.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Amy and Frank fled down the stairs from her office and met an
unexpected obstacle to their exit, a locked door.  As
they peered out the window, they saw yesterday&rsquo;s Amy pull up in the
parking space, get out, retrieve her laptop, and start to head in
the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh good, we can take your car&rdquo;, said Frank.</p>

<p>Amy took a second to recover from the shock of seeing what her hair really
looked like from behind and then asked, &ldquo;But, how can we get to it?
The door is locked, and we
can&rsquo;t go back up to the office&hellip; I would meet myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank smiled, pulled out the <em>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Clojure</em> and
pulled up a page with the heading <em>Locked Doors and Other Small
Bothers</em>.</p>

<p><em>One of the reasons for the surprising success of <strong>The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide
to Clojure</strong> is helpful advice of on an assortment of practical
matters.</em></p>

<p><em>Locked doors are a common nuisance in modern times.  Fortunately,
Clojure provides a very handy function for such occasions, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/1.2.0/clojure.core/fnil">fnil</a>.
This commonly overlooked function, takes an existing function and
returns a new function that allows you to specify a default
for a nil parameter. For example, take this locked door:</em></p>

<p><em>In this case, the simple application of fnil will help remove this

<p><em>Please be advised, that some doors are locked for a good reason. It
is left to the user&rsquo;s discretion. But it is highly recommended in Norway&rsquo;s
moose regions, to think twice.</em></p>

<p>They unlocked the door and headed for Amy&rsquo;s car.  She couldn&rsquo;t decide
whether she was surprised or not to find her keys in her pocket, so
she gave up and just got in instead.  After a short drive, they
arrived at the zoo and navigated their way through various
school groups and arrive at the Aquarium.</p>

<p>Amy at this point, having prided herself on her adaptable nature, was
still having trouble processing the latest events. She had
discovered that Frank was a Datomic time traveller,  the  world was
made of Clojure, and it was also about to be destroyed in a short
future that she just came from.  Her rational brain, (which was
currently working way too hard), was quite
relieved to be distracted by the sight of two really adorable otters.  They were floating
contentedly around the pool, occasionally stopping to crack an Abalone
shell on their fuzzy tummies.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sea-otters.jpg"></p>

<p>Her rational brain, after having a nice breather, finally re-asserted
itself and made Amy ask Frank:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otters are the front-line Chrono-guards, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to explain that otters are tasked with the important job of
keeping a close watch on human civilization and making critical, minor
adjustments to keep things on an even track.  All those nature videos
of otters cracking shells with rocks?  They are really evaluating
Clojure expressions crucial to our way of life. Most of the time, they
prefer to do their work remote.  They find floating on their backs in
the peaceful waters the most productive work environment.  However,
sometimes they will construct zoos or aquariums, when their work
requires them to keep a closer watch on some areas.  In times of great
need, they might even take a human form for a short while.  Recently,
one of their agents was inadvertently
<a href="https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6003866624/h0B1E03BF/">exposed</a> and
required a few extra Abalone shells to straighten out.</p>

<p>Frank opened his pack and handed his evaluator to Amy to hold
while fished out four mini-marshmallows.  He gave two to Amy and then
proceeded to put one in his ear and the other in his mouth.  More
remarkably still, he appeared to be speaking with the otters.</p>

<p><em>Mini-marshmallows are the best way to create portable Clojure
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> channels that
won&rsquo;t melt in your hands.</em></p>

<p><em>To construct a channel simply use <em>chan</em></em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Channels by default are unbuffered, which keeps them at the
mini-marshmallow size.  It requires a rendezvous of a channel producer
and consumer to communicate.  In the case of otters, someone to talk to
the otters and the otters, themselves, to listen. Be advised that with
a regular blocking put <strong>>!!</strong>, the main thread will be blocked.
That is, if you try to speak to the otter, you will be stuck there
until it gets around to listening. This isn&rsquo;t the best case for the talker if the
otter was busy, so one approach would be to use a
<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/future">future</a> to
talk to the otter with a blocking put <em>>!!</em>.</em></p>

<p>Amy put one of the mini-marshmallows in her ear.  She immediately
began to hear the conversation that Frank was having with the otters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who would want to destroy the entire world?  That is really kinda
over-board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know, but there was someone on Galactic Hacker News
the other day that was quite tiffed over the idea that Clojure was considered
a Lisp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amy reached to put the other marshmallow in her mouth to ask a very
important question.  But unfortunately, as she moved her hand, she
accidentally pushed the big red <em>Source</em> button on the evaluator.
Suddenly, she and Frank were swept up in a vortex that spun them
around and sucked them down into the ground.</p>
